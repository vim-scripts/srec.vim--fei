the ftplugin can detect whether the current record's format is
correct,
if the data count is wrong, it will produce a message:
========================
    The data count of this record(3) is wrong!
========================
in which the 3 is the line number of the record.
if the checksum is absense, the message will be:
========================
This record looks have no checksum, press <C-K> to generate checksum for it
========================
If the checksum is present, but wrong, it will complain about:
========================
The Check sum is wrong!, should be: 0x27, Press <C-K> to correct it
========================
 the 0x27 is the right CheckSum for it.

Anytime You can press <C-K> to correct the checksum of current record. regardless of whether the checksum is already contained in the recorder. but if the data count is incorrect, nothing will be done.

With this plugin, one can easily modify existing s-record file, and then re-generate the checksum.
